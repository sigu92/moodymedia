# Product Requirements Document: Enhanced Checkout System

## Introduction/Overview

The current cart system has several usability issues: slow cart feedback, poor visibility of cart contents, and a complex checkout process. This PRD outlines a complete redesign of the cart and checkout experience to create a modern, streamlined purchasing flow that reduces cart abandonment and improves user experience.

The new system will replace the current cart page with an instant-feedback cart icon in the header, a slide-out sidebar for cart management, and a comprehensive 4-step checkout process that handles niche selection, content options, billing, and order management.

## Goals

1. **Reduce Cart Abandonment:** Achieve 90% reduction in cart abandonment through instant feedback and streamlined checkout
2. **Improve User Experience:** Provide immediate visual feedback when items are added to cart (< 500ms response time)
3. **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure the cart sidebar and checkout work seamlessly on all devices
4. **Streamlined Checkout:** Create a clear 4-step process that guides users through purchase completion
5. **Flexible Content Options:** Allow users to choose between self-provided content or professional writing services

## User Stories

- **As a buyer,** I want to view my cart contents in a slide-out sidebar so that I can quickly check items without leaving the marketplace page
- **As a buyer,** I want to select specific niches for each media placement during checkout so that I get the right pricing based on the publisher's multipliers

- **As a buyer,** I want to upload my content files (Word docs, Google Docs) during checkout so that I can complete the entire purchase process in one session
- **As a buyer,** I want the option to purchase multiple placements from the same media outlet so that I can scale my campaigns effectively

### Admin Stories
