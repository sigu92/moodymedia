## Automated Security Checks

You can run automated security checks using the security manager:

```javascript
// Run comprehensive security audit
const auditResult = securityManager.audit();
console.log('Security Score:', auditResult.score);
console.log('Compliance Status:', auditResult.compliance);

// Check for API key exposure
const exposureRisks = securityManager.apiKeys.detectClientSideExposure();
console.log('Exposure Risks:', exposureRisks);

// Validate current security configuration
const config = securityManager.getConfig();
console.log('Security Configuration:', config);

// Review recent security events
const events = securityManager.getEvents();
console.log('Security Events:', events.filter(e => e.severity === 'critical'));
```

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Check SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443 -servername yourdomain.com

# Test webhook endpoint security
curl -X POST your-webhook-url -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test": "data"}'

# Validate HTTPS headers
curl -I https://yourdomain.com

# Check for mixed content
# Use browser developer tools Network tab
```
