# üîß Fix RLS Infinite Recursion Error

## üö® Problem
You're getting an "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'user_role_assignments'" error when trying to fetch role information.

## üîç Root Cause
The Row Level Security (RLS) policy for the `user_role_assignments` table was trying to check admin permissions by querying the same table, creating infinite recursion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution

### Step 1: Run the Fix Script
1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Open your project in [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Navigate to **SQL Editor**

2. **Copy the SQL Script**
   - Copy the entire contents of `fix-rls-recursion.sql` file
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor

3. **Run the Script**
   - Click **"Run"** to execute the SQL
   - You should see: `"RLS Policies Fixed - Test Query Working"`

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
1. **Refresh your application**
2. **Go to Settings page** (`/settings`)
3. **Scroll down to "Debug Role Status"**
4. **Click "Fetch Debug Info"**
5. **You should now see your actual roles instead of the recursion error**

### Step 3: Test Role Switching
1. **If you have both buyer and publisher roles**, the RoleSwitcher should appear
2. **Try switching between buyer and publisher modes**
3. **The navigation should update accordingly**

## üìã What the Fix Does

### Before (Broken)
```sql
-- This policy caused infinite recursion
CREATE POLICY "System admins can manage all role assignments"
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.user_role_assignments ura
    WHERE ura.user_id = auth.uid()
    AND ura.role IN ('admin'::app_role, 'system_admin'::app_role)
  )
);
```

### After (Fixed)
```sql
-- New secure function that doesn't trigger RLS
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_user_admin(user_uuid uuid DEFAULT auth.uid())
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
-- Direct query without RLS recursion
$$;

-- Safe policies using the function
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own role assignments"
USING (
  auth.uid() = user_id
  OR public.is_user_admin() = true
);
```

## üéØ Expected Results

After running the fix:
- ‚úÖ No more infinite recursion errors
- ‚úÖ Role queries work properly
- ‚úÖ Dual-role users can switch between buyer/publisher modes
- ‚úÖ RoleSwitcher appears for users with both roles
- ‚úÖ Debug tools show actual role data

## üö® If Issues Persist

If you still have problems after running the fix:

1. **Check the SQL execution** - Make sure the script ran successfully
2. **Refresh your browser cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Clear application data** - Sign out and sign back in
4. **Check browser console** - Look for any remaining errors

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the SQL execution results in Supabase
2. Look at browser console for error messages
3. Try the debug tools in Settings ‚Üí Debug Role Status

The fix script is designed to be safe and reversible. It only modifies RLS policies and doesn't affect your data.
